# Module 5 Challenge - Work Day Scheduler

## Challenge Details
In this challenge we were asked to create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of their work day. This application should run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The application must also use the Moment.js library to work with date and time.

The Work Day Scheduler has time blocks for the hours of the work day: 9am to 5pm. Time blocks in grey are the hours that have past. The time block in red represents the current hour it is and the time blocks in green are the remaining hours in the workday that are in the future.

In each time block, the user can input text to organize their day.

By pressing the Save button to the right of each time block, the task will save and remain. Don't forget to save! If the Save button is not pressed, on refresh the text will disappear.
